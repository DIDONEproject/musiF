    "# Getting started `musif`\n",
    "\n",
    "`musif` is a Python library to analyze music scores. It is a tool to massively extract features from MusicXML and MuseScore files.\n",
    "\n",
    "`musif` was born in the context of the [ERC Project \"DIDONE\"](https://didone.eu/) and, consequently,\n",
    "it is specialized in 18th-century Italian opera arias. However, it is also prepared to work with other repertoires.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an introduction for people who are not experts in programming. If you are already an expert, just skip to the [Data Section](#data) and then go to the [Advanced Tutorial](https://musif.didone.eu/Tutorial%20poprock.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you should install [`Python`](https://www.python.org/downloads/) > 3.10. An easy way to do this is by using [`Anaconda`](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), especially if you are not used to commandline interface.A\n",
    "Once you have installed `anaconda`:\n",
    "1. Launch the `anaconda-navigator`\n",
    "2. [Create an environment](https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/getting-started/#managing-environments) selecting python version >= 3.10\n",
    "3. Switch to the newly created environment by clicking on its name\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To install `musif`:\n",
    "1. [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIDONEproject/musif/main/docs/source/Tutorial.ipynb) this notebook.\n",
    "2. Start `jupyter` in your Anaconda environment.\n",
    "3. Open this tutorial.\n",
    "4. Run the following cell by clicking on it and pressing Ctrl+Enter."
